    <h1>Editorial</h1>
    <h2><br>The school magazine has always been a source of wonder for a lot of people and they intently look forward to it every year. Being a part of this team has helped all of us learn a lot, not only while working on the magazine but also from each other. Working for hours and days on end, we have all made amazing friends along the way. Coding, designing, compiling etc all of these fascinating tasks have given us clarity on our careers. We now know where our interests lie and how we want to pursue them. 
        Overall, this entire journey has prepared us for all the exciting things headed our way and we have learnt that “Teamwork makes the Dreamwork”.

        <br>Despite the fact. That I joined the coding team a few months later. I quickly began working on understanding the structure of the website, with Gaurav Shah's Invaluable guidance, had learned how crucial synergy is for a project of this scale. Only sitting in meetings with Gautham and Gaurav. Have I realized that an issue as small as a missing comma sometimes took hours to find & sometimes gave up and simply headed to our beloved companions Stack Overflow and W3 schools to ctrl c ctrl v. for me, the completion of the magazine wasn't a goal, it was a journey from new skills being learned to new friendships being formed? My participation in this project is something that I will never forget, the memories made along the way with Gaurav and Gautam in my team is one priceless memoir to reminisce.
        
        -Dheer<br>
        
        <br>Building this magazine was no easy task. Without Gaurav’s guidance, mine and Dheer’s hard work, we wouldn't be here. I am very much proud of this magazine which I would call a piece of art. I absolutely loved the experience of coding it. I learnt so much about web development and it truly gave me an insight into the career itself.
        The magazine is not just a website or a stack of codes for me. It’s the blood, sweat and tears of the coding team, the coffees that were consumed, the brains that were exhausted, the nights that were wasted away, the hard work of Gaurav, Dheer and Gautam, all in ‘a bunch of lines’.
        
        -Gautam<br>
        
        <br>Our journey as the coding team began with the simplest of decisions. Who to recruit, what platform to use, etc. We began from the ground up, taking inspiration from the previous magazine, with the intention to make one even better than that. We were so lucky to have a coding team that was ready to put in the work and constantly learn and innovate to make this project a success.
        
        We hope you enjoy the love and care we have put into every little detail of this magazine.<br>
