        <p>The school magazine has always been a source of wonder for a lot of people and they intently look forward
            to it every year. Being a part of this team has helped all of us learn a lot, not only while working on the
            magazine but also from each other. Working for hours and days on end, we have all made amazing friends along
            the way. Coding, designing, compiling etc all of these fascinating tasks have given us clarity on our
            careers. We now know where our interests lie and how we want to pursue them.
            Overall, this entire journey has prepared us for all the exciting things headed our way and we have learnt
            that “Teamwork makes the Dreamwork”.</p>

            <h3 class="individualEditorialName">Dheer Ramnani</h3>
            <p class="individualEditorialText">Despite the fact that I joined the coding team a few months later, I
                began working on understanding the website's structure. With Gaurav Shah's invaluable guidance, I
                learned how crucial synergy is for a project of this scale. Only sitting in meetings with Gautam and
                Gaurav, have I realized that an issue as small as a missing comma sometimes took hours to find &
                sometimes we gave up and simply headed to our beloved companions Stack Overflow and W3 schools to Ctrl+C
                Ctrl+V. For me, the completion of the magazine wasn't a goal, it was a journey from new skills being
                learned to new friendships being formed. My participation in this project is something that I will never
                forget, the memories made along the way with Gaurav and Gautam in my team is one priceless memory to
                reminisce.</p>

            <p class="individualEditorialText">Building this magazine was no easy task. Without Gaurav’s guidance, mine
                and Dheer’s hard work, we
                wouldn't be here. I am very much proud of this magazine which I would call a piece of art. I absolutely
                loved the experience of coding it. I learnt so much about web development and it truly gave me an
                insight
                into the career itself.
                The magazine is not just a website or a stack of codes for me. It’s the blood, sweat and tears of the
                coding
                team, the coffees that were consumed, the brains that were exhausted, the nights that were spent,
                the
                hard work of Gaurav, Dheer and Gautam, all in ‘a bunch of lines’.</p>

            <p class="individualEditorialText">Our journey as the coding team began with the simplest of decisions. Who
                to recruit, what platform to
                use, etc. We began from the ground up, taking inspiration from the previous magazine, with the intention
                to
                make one even better than that. We were so lucky to have a coding team that was ready to put in the work
                and
                constantly learn and innovate to make this project a success. The determination and hardwork of this
                team, despite the many challenges along the way, will remain an inspiration to me.

                We hope you enjoy the love and care we have put into every little detail of this magazine.<br></p>

        Creativity is a function of leadership. It requires navigating uncharted territory and having the courage to face adversity to bring your vision into fruition.” 
        The magazine team was a beautiful journey and a very big learning experience of teamwork and creativity. It felt like jumping into the abyss at first, but then the fear turned into excitement. We met a new set of people, learned, explored and innovated with them. Our magazine delivers great content to their readers in a conversational style that creates a rapport. This herculean task of editing our school magazine has been possible only with the sincere support and efforts of the members. All of us brainstormed for hours and days on how to create new designs and make this magazine even better than the one before. We hope we can learn and teach as we go along the way. </p>
