            <p class="headMessageContent">
                <br>“Success is a journey, not a destination. You may not be where you want to be or do what you want to
                do when you're on the journey. But you've got to have the determination, vision and foresight that leads
                you to an incredible end.”<br> <br>14 years ago, a five-year-old little boy with big dreams walked into
                this school. 14 years later, he stands honoured and humbled to not only be part of this school’s rich
                history but thankful for the opportunities the school has given him to grow, develop and define himself
                as an individual.<br> <br>Being elected as Head Boy of Indian Language School was something I dreamt of
                since my early years in school. I am who I am today only because of the values that ILS has instilled in
                me. I owe my confidence and success to ILS and will forever be grateful.<br> <br>My journey at Indian
                Language School has seen massive changes, not only within the staff and buildings but in the way we look
                at our school. I have seen the school grow and evolve whilst keeping its traditions, standards and core
                values.<br> <br>The one thing I value the most and is also a precious gift this institution has given to
                all its students is a strong character along with integrity, ethics and a growth mindset. The reason I
                say this is because time and again the students of Indian Language School have proved their worth. Since
                1982 ILS has always been flying high, setting new benchmarks for itself year after year. <br> <br>ILS is
                turning 40 years in 2022 and once again we have shown what we are made up of because even the pandemic
                could stop us from achieving our goals and dreams. I would like to commend the immense efforts put in by
                our teachers to get accustomed to using new software and helping us realize the idea of “Schooling from
                Home.” Due to their efforts, we could experience a seamless transition into online learning as they got
                us familiarized with Zoom, Google Classroom, TedEd lessons, Nearpod, and several other platforms to keep
                our learning interesting and uninterrupted.<br> This year has been extremely successful for the student
                council. We re-introduced the Science Paper Presentation and successfully conducted the Inter-House
                Sports Competition. We ensured that even during the lockdown, our festive celebrations took place in the
                form of virtual special assemblies. We were glad to host talk shows related to Coronavirus and have
                special addresses from counsellors, and other professionals. Students would lighten up our day in the
                morning assembly by showcasing talents such as cooking, decorating, and various essential life skills.
                None of this would have been possible without the relentless efforts put in by our Respected Principal
                Mrs Sonali Gupta, Our Vice-Principals, Senior Leaders, and Teachers. They have always been there to
                guide us on the right path. I would also like to thank the school administration, maintenance and the
                non-teaching staff for always helping us whenever needed. And of course, the students, who not only
                elected us to represent them but also cooperated with us on every step of our journey. I would like to
                thank my family for their guidance and blessings throughout my life. My message to all the students at
                Indian Language School, Know what you are capable of because no matter the odds, YOU Can Achieve Any
                Goal - be it big or small - If you Put Your Heart and Mind into it. I am sure ILS will continue what it
                does best - “FLYING HIGH”. Believe. Seek. Succeed.

            <p class="headMessageContent">
                <br>I knew this day would come when I would have to write a note for the magazine, but I am going, to be
                honest with you. I am emotional, overwhelmed and confused. So, I am going to do what I do best, and tell
                you a story. My story. 14 years have passed since I stepped foot into this esteemed institution, and I
                cannot believe that the time to bid farewell has approached so soon. It is quite difficult to pin down
                and sum up all the emotions and memories gushing into my mind, but I will say that this journey has been
                a rollercoaster ride. <br> <br>Sumedha Mohan, Head Girl of Indian Language School! Saying it out loud a
                year hence still gives me chills and puts a huge smile on my face. I specifically remember the first
                time I was recognised as a leader when my 8th grade English teacher applauded me for managing my group
                exceptionally well. I always wanted to be a part of the student council but was never courageous enough
                to put myself out there. I finally convinced myself with the help of my parents and friends that I have
                what it takes and stood for the elections of the year 2021-22 and was elected head girl. First and
                foremost, a huge thank you to all those who stood by me and trusted me. It has been a privilege and
                honour to have served the school and its students. In my election speech, I said - I will lead by
                example and this post helped me fulfil that promise. It taught me to express, connect and encourage
                every student but also learn from each one of you. I learnt to listen better and thus care for the needs
                of the students. My wholehearted thanks to all those who believed and guided me through this wondrous
                journey. It is never too late to try! So, to all those aspiring leaders, it is imperative that you
                believe in yourself and your abilities. Then and only then will you be of service to others. <br>
                <br>During this academic year, we saw an increase in participation in all activities, academic and
                otherwise. Our school was yet again recognised on multiple international forums and the students all the
                way from 1st to 12th grade brought back laurels to ILS. We helped organise along with the Student Voice
                Group, for the first time in ILS history “Innovation Day” which was a huge success. After 2 years, we
                physically conducted the “Science Paper Presentation” and the “Inter-House Sports Week”. This could not
                have been accomplished without the never-ending support of our Principal Mrs Sonali Gupta, our Vice
                Principals Dr Mrs Manisha Jain and Mrs Ishita Yadav and last and not least the students without whose
                cooperation and support, these events would not have been successful. <br> <br>In the last three years,
                since the outbreak of the coronavirus, we were all isolated and put in a situation that demanded
                introspection and thus a change in perspective. We were instantly forced to change our very lifestyle.
                From enjoying weeks of extra holiday to longing for just one more moment with our friends and teachers
                at school, we too had a change of heart as students towards our school. Every moment counts! We all
                learnt this one way or another these past couple of years and it has made us stronger for it. I am proud
                to say that Indian Language School is a tight-knit family! We braved and bested every difficulty with
                zeal and enthusiasm.<br> <br>As ILS completes 40 years of its establishment, I am overjoyed to have been
                part of this year's outgoing batch. I would like to extend to all the students, teachers, and
                non-teaching staff my heartiest congratulations and sincere gratitude. As I pass the baton down to the
                next batch of seniors, I wish you all the very best and offer my confidence! I am sure the ILS flag will
                always be kept flying high.<br>

                with one another. It is by no means been all perfect or always gone to plan but not only have we
                survived but we have also thrived, and we must be proud of this.<br><br>I would like to take this

                this year to ensure we still receive quality education and an impeccable school experience while still
                dedicating time into the betterment of this school. Being the Vice Head boy of this school has been the
                greatest honour I have had, and I will cherish it forever. I cannot wait for the school to go from
                strength to strength as we continue to be known not for what we lost to the pandemic but for the world
                our school has created from it.<br>

                already adapted to live the lifestyle that was new to us in 2020, which made every event in 2021 an
                enthusiastic, energy filled experience with more competitions online and offline. <br> <br>Starting from
                the
                daily assembly, talk shows, competitions, special assembly, festival celebrations which really brought
                out students with hidden talents. AND working together as a team really made it more special. I would
                like to thank the Principal, Vice-Principals, teachers and especially the students at Indian Language
                School, for making this the best year ever!!!
