This curiosity to learn has driven and motivated me over the years. For example, I never thought of myself as a computer geek (I still use my apps on light mode üòÖ) but out of necessity, I learnt how to code and now, it‚Äôs a huge part of my life.",

It taught me that no matter the situation we can find ourself in, always remember that we are the most powerful person. No one else has the power to influence our self-confidence and self-esteem like we can,that is 100% on us. We are the judge, jury and executioner of our own awesomeness,every single day.",
    "Famous Personality": "A famous personality who has always motivated me would be Priyanka Chopra. Just like me she was born in a small city named \"Jamshedpur\" and since has been a pride of our place. \n\nShe has never been afraid to push the boundaries, believing in working on her own path and it worked on her favour. She's a hustler and lives on coffee but the physical tiredness doesn't stop her brain to stop bubbling with creativity.\nShe's a successful actress, singer, producer and entrepreneur all rolled into one and inspires us to live our dream in any possible way. \nWith this I would like to quote one of her lines,\n\"I have always felt that life is a solidarity journey, that we are each on a train, riding through our hours, our days, our years. We get on alone, we leave alone, and the decisions we make as we travel on the train are our responsibility alone,\"\n\nEnjoying your own company, being independent, bold and wearing your confidence proudly can make invincible. \nThis is what I have learnt from the journey of PeeCee. \n"
