        The most annoying noise is that of free advise
        because everyone just seems to think they are intellectuals and wise.
        People just start to annoy you a lot
        Because they think their way is correct while yours is not
        They even like to comment on stuff they don’t know
        Like," Are you sure this is the way rice is supposed to grow?"
        Then the sarcastic people come with their grand entrance
        and seriously those people can make you insecure about your appearance.

        They think the world obeys their rules
        And everyone else are a bunch of fools
        But what they dont know is that behind their backs people laugh
        When they remember these people acting smart.

        If I woke as Tony Stark on his luxurious 3000 dollar bed,the  first thing I would
        do would brush using his toothpaste plated in 24 karat gold,then I would then eat the
        most luxurious breakfast of pizza and chicken nuggets, again coated with
        24 karat gold with cutlery with diamonds embedded in them. Since I am Iron man, I
        would travel around the world with my suite as with a top speed of 1.7 Mach,
        this rocket can move at 1304 mph. For lunch I would go to sublimotion in Ibiza 
        which is the most expensive restaurant in the world, because I am a billionaire
        .Then I will release all the prisoners in the city and make it look like an accident
        just so I can capture them again myself and increase my fame . At the end of the
        day I will copy all of  Mr. Stark's  important scientific data into a drive and
        delete the original copy so when on the next day  things return back to how they
        were, I would become ironman’s arch-nemesis and make my own suite to fight
        for my place in the avengers.

        If I became iron man for one day, I would visit Nick Fury and try shaking his
        hand. Then I would see all the AI and technology he owns and study then
        thoroughly. Then I would wear the hulk buster and take a quick ride with it.
        Then I would try giving some father-son type talk to spiderman so he may have
        confidence to be a better hero. Then I would try making my own suit using his
        tech and try to make it as cool as possible. Then I would sit in the top of stark
        tower and see the sun set while eating a doughnut.

        The infuriation caused by the maddening ting of the alarm that separates you
        from your sound sleep while you’re in warm embrace of your blanket and
        resting on the lap of your comforting bed is the worst feeling a person can
        experience. The sound itself is designed to be sharp and annoying that you have no
        other choice to wake up and turn it off. It becomes the most annoying in the
        time of worrisome events like exams. It causes you to overcome your
        comforting bed and get up is always associated with negative thoughts which I
        relate with. But we also have to realize it is a reflection of the hardships in life.
        It signifies getting out of our comfort zone so that we are equipped for what is
        to come in our day.  Even if we always feel bad that we have to wake up to the
        alarm we can always thank it at the end of the day for waking us up for the
        beautiful day ahead.

        The most irritating sound in the world is the sound of fire crackers . Fire crackers cause a
        lot of sound pollution and have been identified as one of the major sources of noise
        pollution in India . The high noise caused by fire crackers may trigger  problems like
        stress and  hearing loss. The sound of high noise making fire crackers often disturbs your
        sleep and irritate you. But this doesn't mean that we shouldn’t burst crackers because
        many children and adults enjoy bursting crackers on festivals like Diwali and New Year, we
        can burst crackers but we should try bursting crackers that make less sound so that
        others don’t get disturbed by the loud noise of it .)
